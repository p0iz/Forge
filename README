Forge - a modular game engine framework
=======================================

Forge aims to be a game engine framework in the sense that
you can plug the functionality you need into it and run it
without getting into every little detail in implementing a
game.

This project is far from finished yet.

It currently just loads a mesh and material from
hard-coded paths and displays duplicates of it.

Currently only a Linux backend is implemented. The aim is
to create enough of an abstraction between Forge and the
underlying system to make implementing backends for
other platforms easy.
