Forge - a modular game engine framework
=======================================

Forge aims to be a game engine framework in the sense that
you can plug the functionality you need into it and run it
without getting into every little detail in implementing a
game.

This project is far from finished yet.

It currently just loads a mesh and material from
hard-coded paths and displays duplicates of it.
